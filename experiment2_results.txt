\subsection{Experiment 2 Results}

Experiment 2 consisted of two parts: a 6-trial exploration phase to find optimal brightness mixing ratios, followed by a 3-trial parameter adjustment phase to evaluate velocity perception characteristics.

\subsubsection{Exploration Phase Results}

In the exploration phase, participants adjusted the brightness mixing ratio to minimize velocity fluctuations in the lower image. The median values from 6 trials for each participant were as follows:

\item ONO: 0.633 (mean: 0.680, std: 0.158)
\item LL: 0.218 (mean: 0.263, std: 0.172)
\item HOU: 0.316 (mean: 0.378, std: 0.195)
\item OMU: 0.734 (mean: 0.714, std: 0.123)
\item YAMA: 0.615 (mean: 0.643, std: 0.072)

\end{itemize}

The exploration results show individual differences in preferred brightness mixing ratios, ranging from 0.218 to 0.734.

\subsubsection{Parameter Adjustment Phase Results}

Using the optimized brightness mixing ratios from the exploration phase, participants adjusted the velocity function parameters $v(t) = V_0 + A_1\sin(\omega t + \phi_1) + A_2\sin(2\omega t + \phi_2)$ to match velocity sensations between upper and lower images.

The average parameter values across all participants were:

\item $V_0 = 1.072$
\item $A_1 = 0.489$
\item $\phi_1 = 2.817$ (0.897$\pi$)
\item $A_2 = 0.368$
\item $\phi_2 = 1.857$ (0.591$\pi$)

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparison with Experiment 1}

The optimized brightness mixing ratios in Experiment 2 resulted in improved velocity perception characteristics compared to the linear mixing approach in Experiment 1. The average $V_0$ value of 1.072 in Experiment 2 is closer to the theoretical value of 2.0 than the results from Experiment 1, indicating that the redesigned mixing function successfully improved velocity reproduction accuracy.

This improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed brightness mixing approach in compensating for image transmission delay in remote control systems while maintaining subjective velocity equivalence.
