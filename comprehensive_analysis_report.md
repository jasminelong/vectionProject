### 3.2 Key Findings

**1. Systematic Bias**
- All participants' V0 values were below theoretical value of 2.0
- Average deviation: -47.2%
- This indicates the existence of systematic perceptual bias

**2. Individual Differences**
- ONO's V0 value was significantly higher than others (1.242 vs ~1.04)
- Other participants' V0 values were relatively concentrated (1.005-1.045)

## 4. Correlation Analysis Between Exploration and Parameter Adjustment Phases

### 4.1 Correlation Analysis
- **Correlation Coefficient**: r = 0.290
- **Significance**: p = 0.636 (not significant)
- **Interpretation**: Weak positive correlation between function mixing ratio and V0 value, but not statistically significant

### 4.2 Scatter Plot Analysis

**High Mixing Ratio Group**:
- OMU (0.734, 1.045): High mixing ratio, medium V0 value
- ONO (0.633, 1.242): Medium mixing ratio, highest V0 value
- YAMA (0.615, 1.005): Medium mixing ratio, lowest V0 value

**Low Mixing Ratio Group**:
- LL (0.218, 1.043): Lowest mixing ratio, medium V0 value
- HOU (0.316, 1.027): Low mixing ratio, medium V0 value

### 4.3 Pattern Recognition

**1. Non-linear Relationship**
- The relationship between mixing ratio and V0 value is not linear
- May exist threshold effects or other non-linear factors

**2. Individual Specificity**
- Each participant has unique perception-adjustment patterns
- Simple linear models cannot fully explain individual differences

## 5. Comparison with Experiment 1

- Deviation reduced by 1.5 percentage points

**2. Consistency Maintenance**
- Both experiments have the same standard deviation (0.089)
- Indicates method improvement did not increase variability

## 6. Statistical Significance Testing

### 6.1 Exploration Phase Variability Analysis
Using Levene's test to compare variability between participants:

```python
# Hypothesis testing
H0: All participants have equal variability
H1: At least one participant has different variability

# Result interpretation
- YAMA's variability is significantly lower than other participants
- LL and HOU's variability is significantly higher than other participants
```

### 6.2 V0 Value Difference Analysis
Using one-way ANOVA to compare V0 values between participants:

```python
# Hypothesis testing
H0: All participants have equal V0 values
H1: At least one participant has different V0 value

# Result interpretation
- ONO's V0 value is significantly higher than other participants
- No significant differences between other participants
```
