- Other participants' V0 values were relatively concentrated

### 2. Statistical Significance Test Results

**Variability Analysis:**
- Levene's test: p = 0.5290 (no significant differences)
- But descriptive statistics show obvious variability differences

**Mean Difference Analysis:**
- One-way ANOVA: p = 0.1270 (no significant differences)
- Sample size limitations may affect statistical power

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.290, p = 0.636 (not significant)
