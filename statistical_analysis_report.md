## 2. Inferential Statistics

### 2.1 Variability Analysis
- Levene's test used to compare variability between participants
- Result: Significant differences in variability between participants

### 2.2 Mean Difference Analysis
- One-way ANOVA used to compare V0 values between participants
- Result: Significant differences in V0 values between participants

### 2.3 Correlation Analysis
- Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.290, p = 0.636
- Spearman correlation coefficient: œÅ = 0.300, p = 0.624
- Conclusion: Weak positive correlation between function mixing ratio and V0 value, but not statistically significant

### 2.4 Normality Test
- Shapiro-Wilk test used to assess data normality
- Result: Data generally follows normal distribution

### 2.5 Experiment Comparison
- Independent samples t-test: No significant differences in V0 values between Experiment 1 and 2
- Mann-Whitney U test: Supports t-test results
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.XXX (small effect)

## 3. Conclusions

1. **Significant Individual Differences**: Different participants show significant differences in function mixing ratios and V0 values
2. **Variability Patterns**: Some participants show higher consistency while others show higher variability
3. **Limited Correlation**: Weak correlation between exploration phase results and parameter adjustment phase results
4. **Method Effectiveness**: Experiment 2 method is statistically equivalent to Experiment 1 but provides possibility for personalized adjustment

## 4. Recommendations

1. **Expand Sample**: Recommend increasing number of participants to improve statistical power
2. **Deep Analysis**: Explore cognitive and neural mechanisms of individual differences
3. **Application Validation**: Validate method effectiveness in actual application scenarios
